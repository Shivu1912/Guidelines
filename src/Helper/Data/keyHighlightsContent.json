    "Fecal microbiota-based therapies, including fecal microbiota transplant and FDA-approved therapies, are the focus of guidelines developed by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA).",
    "The AGAâ€™s guideline aims to provide recommendations for the use of fecal microbiota-based therapies in adults with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection, severe to fulminant C difficile infection, inflammatory bowel diseases (including pouchitis), and irritable bowel syndrome.",
    "Developed using the GRADE framework, the guideline panel prioritized clinical questions, identified patient-centered outcomes, and conducted evidence synthesis.",
    "The guideline panel made 7 recommendations, including the use of fecal microbiota-based therapies in specific scenarios such as recurrent C difficile infection and severe or fulminant cases not responding to standard antibiotics.",
    "Recommendations vary based on the immunocompetence of patients, suggesting select use of therapies in certain populations and against their use in severely immunocompromised individuals.",
    "While fecal microbiota-based therapies are effective for preventing recurrent C difficile in select patients, they are not yet recommended for other gastrointestinal conditions except within the context of clinical trials."
